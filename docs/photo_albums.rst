Here are several of my random photo albums. As you can see, I am quite fond of taking pictures of my possessions.

Rack Cabinet
============

Ever since I took a Cisco CCNA class back in high school in 2002 I've always wanted a rack at home. I even bought one on
Craigslist in 2007 for $100 but it had round holes and it was very shallow. Turns out it was meant for music equipment.

Eventually I came across this one back at Symantec as they were about to throw it away once our lab was shut down. I
also scored that tape autoloader and 2200VA UPS, and over $500 worth of brand new, never used, still shrink wrapped
LTO-3 tapes. They were in a garbage bin!
