This is my personal website. It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), generously hosted for free on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using a [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme (actually it's
[Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)).

Besides using Bootswatch, this theme is entireley "custom made" by me. It's kind of usable by others but some changes
will probably have to be made if you want to fork this repo.

If you do want to fork it, the "main" file would be **_layouts/post.html**.
