This is my personal website. It's built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), hosted on
[NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/), using the
[Read the Docs Theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme) theme.

I use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automatically build and push HTML files to NFSN (using rsync) every time I
push them to this GitHub repo.
