title: Desk Pictures at Home (California)

The [other page]({% post_url 2013-07-15-Desk-Pictures-at-Home %}) was getting too big, so now that I've moved
to California I'll start with a fresh one.

Full set of high-resolution pictures for all workspaces are available at

        My desk and rack share a wall, which I run cables through. I've removed the rack's side panel to show where I
        put my cable modem. Also, my home theater amp powers my TV and Computer's audio using dual-zone.
