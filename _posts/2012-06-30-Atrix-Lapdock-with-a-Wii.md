title: Atrix Lapdock with a Wii
---

I don't have a 360 or PS3, but I have a Wii and after I found an HDMI adapter I tried it with the Lapdock. Turns out it
works just fine. The Lapdock takes care of changing resolution as long as it's at or below 1366x768. Audio works too by
the way. This should work just fine with the Xbox 360, PS3, or any other HDMI devices.

* Adapters used:
    * [HDMI Male to Micro HDMI Female](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/hdmi-male-to-micro-hdmi-female-adapter-66079)
      (delivery took one month)
    * HDMI Female/Female Coupler
    * [Wii HDMI Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057UNPQO/)

        The Wii looks pretty good on the Lapdock, very usable while traveling. I didn't notice any ghosting either.
