I can use the Atrix Lapdock as a secondary display for my laptop. At home my laptop is docked to two monitors, so every
time I traveled I had to deal with a single monitor. Not anymore! I don't even have to take it out of my carry-on when
I travel.

* Adapters used:
    * [HDMI Male to Micro HDMI Female](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/hdmi-male-to-micro-hdmi-female-adapter-66079)
      (delivery took one month)
    * HDMI Female/Female Coupler
