I bought the Atrix Lapdock since I couldn't find any sub $100 portable HDMI displays. The only affordable displays I
could find were USB only. With the Atrix Lapdock and some adapters, I was able to use it as a portable display for
several devices, which is great for traveling.

It's a good idea to remove the plate on the docking area (underneath where the phone would be). It makes it easier to
plug in the adapters or have to sand/shave them less. You can easily pull it off with your finger nails (the plate
actually has a couple of magnets to keep it in place, and two small plastic clips).

the old unified article.

    it should easily come off. More room for HDMI/USB adapters.</figcaption>

posted about the Lapdock (the second shows that the Lapdock 500 isn't "hacker-friendly").
