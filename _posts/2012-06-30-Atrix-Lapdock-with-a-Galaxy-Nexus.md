title: Atrix Lapdock with a Galaxy Nexus
---

The Galaxy Nexus works fine with the Lapdock, however only HDMI (video) works. The MHL standard disables USB when using
HDMI, so the Lapdock's keyboard, touchpad, and USB ports don't work. Charging the phone works though. This will be good
for watching downloaded videos from my phone on the plane (bigger screen and the lapdock works as an additional
battery).

Additionally, the two adapters that connect to the Lapdock had to be modified to fit. I had to shave off some excess
plastic around the connector with a Dremel grinding bit.
